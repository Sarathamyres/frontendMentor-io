## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```
Overall, this project was easy to do. At first I couldn't make the image a good size in the responsive one. I put the project aside for a while and after I started doing it all over again, I “magically” managed to make it good, without using the media querie. I used display flex to center align the items, adjusted their sizes and finally used :root to set variables for the colors. I also added reset.css to remove some properties that appear automatically.

```

### Continued development

Now, I want to improve my CSS skills. I want to learn JavaScript and its tools like React.
